# Tiles

Hacking a crude tile server together.

![tiles](/doc/img/tiles.png)

## Setup

You will need docker + docker compose.

Download an mbtiles file containing the tiles you want to use, and save it in the repo root.

There is a free one available with world data here:

- https://openmaptiles.com/downloads/tileset/osm/?usage=personal

Update `tilestaches.config` with the local path to the just downloaded mbtiles, like so:

```
{
    "cache": {"name": "Test"},
    "layers": {
        "world": {
            "provider": {"name": "mbtiles", "tileset": "/server/<FILENAME HERE>"}
        }   
    }
}

```

Finally:

```
$ make build
```

## Run

```
$ make run
```

## Use!

```
$ make open
```

Or:

 - http://localhost

Voil√°.
